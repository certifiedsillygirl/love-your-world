            swimming with whales (july only) - 'eua island
        </a>
        <p>During migration season (july - october), thousands of whales pass through the deep trench between Tongatapu Island and 
            'Eua Island. Encountering the whales is a strictly snorkel-only experience; no scuba equipment or flashlights are allowed.
            Four guests and one guide may be in the water at once. Humpback whales are very friendly and will allow you to swim alongside them.
            They pose no threat to humans.</p>

        <p>Carved into the side of Kapa Island, Swallows Cave is a notable snorkelling destination and a must-see destination on most boat tours.
            The water inside the cave is as clear as a crystal and home to many species of marine life, including a variety of tropical fish schools,
            rays, and even sea turtles.
