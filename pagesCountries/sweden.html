        <p>The Aurora Sky Station in Northern Sweden is one of the best places in the world to view Aurora Borealis - the Northern
            Lights. The lights become visible from September, but you may still enjoy the Sky Station at any other time of year, as
            it offers midnight sun hiking during summer and chairlift rides all year round.
