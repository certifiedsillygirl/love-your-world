        <p>Aqaba Adventure Divers offers an opportunity to learn how to dive in the crystal clear waters of the Red Sea, and to behold
            its underwater wonders. The course takes place over four days, and anyone above the age of 10 is allowed to come. Over the four days
            there will be five theory sessions, five skill sessions in shallow water and four open water dives.

        <p>The Petra Museum in Wadi Musa contains 280 artefacts, and consists of five halls showing the history of Petra,  capital of the Nabataean Arabs
            and one of the most famous archaeological sites in the world. The ancient city grew rich through trade in frankincense, myrrh, and spices,
            but was later annexed to the Roman Empire, and then destroyed in an earthquake around the 4th century AD. It was deserted by the 7th century AD.

        <p>The Dead Sea is a salt lake bordered on the east border of Jordan and the west border of Israel. The surface of the lake is 430.5m 
            below sea level, which makes its shores the lowest land-based elevation on Earth. The lake is 9.6 times as salty as the ocean, which makes swimming
            in it akin to floating. It is a popular location for therapeutic uses.</p>
