        <p>The Elephant Nature Park is a leading rescue and rehabilitation center in Northern Thailand, founded by 
            the renowned elephant rights advocate Saengduean Chailert, known as Lek. The park has rescued and cared for elephants who were
            subject to cruel practices such as street begging, elephant riding, and circus shows, from which they have suffered both physically
            and psychologically. In the park, they live freely in nature, and are treated with love and respect.</p>

        <p>The New Heaven Reef Conservation Program is located on the Thai island of Koh Tao. The organisation conducts a variety of 
            marine conservation practices, from maintenance of artificial coral reefs to caring for baby turtle hatchlings. The program also
            offers daily projects for people to participate in, regardless of experience.
