            The International Ecotourism Society (TIES) defines ecotourism as “responsible travel to natural areas that conserves the environment, 
            sustains the well-being of the local people, and involves interpretation and education” (2015). Ecotourism involves responsible travel 
            to natural areas, conservation of the environment, and improvement of the lifestyles and well-being of the local peoples.

        <p>
            Unsustainable tourism refers to forms of tourism that fail to conserve tourist resources, the environment, and/or the lives and culture
            of the local peoples. Another big problem is overtourism, the congestion and crowding in locations where there are too many tourists/visitors. 
            Overtourism strains the resources and inhabitants of a destination, preventing them from safeguarding their most valuable assets.

            Unfortunately, many people do not want to try ecotourism, or are hesitant to do so. This is due to the common belief that ecotourism is only available 
            in remote areas, and that ecotourism does not provide the same level of luxury and comfort that other options offer. This is not necessarily true, 
            however, as with thorough research, one can find ecotourism opportunities that don't have a negative impact while providing the luxury and comfort
            that you seek.
